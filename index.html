    <p>Hehehehe, Villager Boy took this website!</p><br><br>
    
    <h1>What happened?</h1>
    <p>This website was a phishing website, but now it has been taken down, so I claimed the domain.</p>

    <h1>Am I safe?</h1>
    <p>Of course you are! Just wait a few more seconds and you'll be redirected to my main website.</p>
